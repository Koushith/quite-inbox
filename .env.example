# Google OAuth Credentials
# Get these from: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

# ============================================================
# IMPORTANT: CLIENT SECRET IS NOT NEEDED WITH PKCE
# ============================================================
# This app uses PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) which is
# designed for public clients (web/mobile apps). Client secrets
# provide ZERO additional security in browser-based apps because
# anyone can view the source code.
#
# RECOMMENDED SETUP: Only use Client ID (no secret)
# ============================================================
#
# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Go to Google Cloud Console > APIs & Services > Credentials
# 2. Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
# 3. Select "Web application" (for production deployment)
# 4. Configure:
#    - Authorized JavaScript origins:
#      * http://localhost:5173 (development)
#      * https://your-domain.com (production)
#    - Authorized redirect URIs:
#      * http://localhost:5173/oauth/callback (development)
#      * https://your-domain.com/oauth/callback (production)
# 5. Click "Create"
# 6. Copy ONLY the Client ID (ignore the secret)
#
# Why PKCE without client secret is secure:
# - Uses cryptographic code_verifier + code_challenge
# - Code verifier never leaves your browser
# - Attackers can't complete OAuth flow without the verifier
# - Follows OAuth 2.0 Security Best Practices (RFC 8252)
#
# See SECURITY.md for detailed security documentation

# Required: Your OAuth Client ID
